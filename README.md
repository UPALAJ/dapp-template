# dapp-template

Inspired by Scaffold-ETH template.

This repository is not meant to be a substitute for the Scaffold-ETH project.

It is intended to serve as a smart contract and dApp template that anyone can use by modifying only a few files.

## Step 2

Modifying Solidity smart contract file

The directory of Solidity can be found in [Hello.sol](./hardhat/contracts/Hello.sol)

## Step 3

Deploy your smart contract

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## Step 4

Copy deployed smart contract address to .env file

## Step 5

Run dApp by using

```shell
npm run dapp
```

## Step 6

Play around within your dApp and/or make modification if needed
